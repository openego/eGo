Release v0.2.0 (July 18, 2018)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fundamental structural changes of the eGo tool are included in this release. A new feature is the integration of the MV grid power flow simulations, performed by the tool `eDisGo. <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo>`_. Thereby, eGo can be used to perforem power flow simulations and optimizations for EHV, HV (*eTraGo*) and MV (*eDisGo*) grids.

Moreover, the use of the Dataprocessing versions ``''v0.4.1''`` and ``''v0.4.2''`` is supported. Please note, that this release is still under construction and only recommended for developers of the *open_eGo* project.

Furthermore, overall cost aggregation functions are available.

Added features
--------------

* Cleaned and restructured eGo classes and functions
    * Moved classes of eGo from results.py to io.py
    * Move serveral function

* Introduce new files for *eDisGo* handling
    * edisgo_integration.py
    * mv_cluster.py

* Introduce new file storages.py  for eTraGo
* Updated eTraGo 0.6 and integrated eTraGo's new functions and features to eGo
* Updated eDisGo 0.0.3 version which includes the features of a parallelization
  for custom function and other important API changes.
* Started to implemented pep8 style to eGo Code
* Implemented logging function for the whole model
* Using the Restfull-API for the OpenEnergy Database connection, buy using
  ego.io v0.4.2. A registration is needed and can be done on
  `openenergy-platform.org/login <http://openenergy-platform.org/login/>`_
* Remove functionalities from ``ego_main.py`` to the eGo class
* Fixed eTraGo scenario import of ``etrago_from_oedb()``


Notes
-----
* As an external user you need to have and account on the
  `openenergy-platform.org/login <http://openenergy-platform.org/login/>`_
* In future versions, all MV grids (*ding0* grids) will be queried from your database. However, in this version all MV grids have to be generated with the tool `ding0 <https://github.com/openego/ding0>`_ and stored in *eGo*'s *data* folder.
* Total operational costs are missing in this release
