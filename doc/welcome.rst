============
The eGo tool
============


The python package eGo is a toolbox and also an application which combines
**eTraGo** - a tool for optimizing flexibility options for transmission grids
based on PyPSA and **eDisGo** - a toolbox in itself capable of analyzing distribution
grids for grid issues and evaluating measures responding these.

The open_eGo project
====================
This software project is part of the research project
`open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.


The OpenEnergy Platform
=======================
Within this project we developed the OpenEnergy Platform which the eGo toolbox
relies upon to get and store in- and output data. Because of this dependency
in order to use eGo a registration on the OpenEnergy Platform is required. For more
information see
`openenergy-platform <https://openenergy-platform.org/>`_ and login.

The OpenEnergy platform mainly addresses students, researchers and scientists in
the field of energy modelling and analytics, but also welcomes all other interested parties.
The platform provides great tools to make your energy system
modelling process transparent. Data of the open_eGo project are stored on
this platform.

eTraGo
------

The python package eTraGo provides an optimization of flexibility options for
transmission grids based on PyPSA. In particular transmission grids of different voltage levels
, that is 380, 220 and 110 kV in Germany, can be handled.
Conventionally the 110kV grid is part of the distribution grid.
The integration of the transmission and ‘upper’ distribution grid
is part of eTraGo.

The focus of optimization are flexibility options with a special focus on
energy storages and grid expansion measures.

eDisGo
------
The python package eDisGo provides a toolbox for analysis and optimization
of distribution grids. It is closely related to the python project Ding0 as this
project is currently the single data source for eDisGo providing synthetic
grid data for whole Germany. `Learn more here <http://edisgo.readthedocs.io>`_.


Dataprocessing
--------------

For the open_eGo project several python packages are developed which are feeded
by the input data of the data processing. The dataprocessing is written in
SQL and Python. `Learn more here <https://data-processing.readthedocs.io/>`_.

ego.io
------

The ``ego.io`` is a `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ interface to
the OpenEnergy database (oedb). The module provides ORM objects mirroring oedb
tables and additionally contains helper functions for I/O operations.
`Learn more here <https://github.com/openego/ego.io>`_.


Dingo
-----

The DIstribution Network GeneratOr (Ding0) is a tool to generate synthetic
medium and low voltage power distribution grids based on open
(or at least accessible) data.
`Learn more here <https://dingo.readthedocs.io/>`_.
